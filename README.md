# DBMS-Project
A Web Application built using HTML and CSS.
The app logic is done in PHP.
The app has basic functionality to login and register. Once logged in, the app allows users to post text blogs with titles and also to follow other users. Users can also like posts that caught their eye.
The database tool used here is SQL and the app runs on local PHP server.
The app used MD5 encryption algorithm to store user data.

As a next step, we need to include media storage and image and video blog posting. We also need to include user profile picture, and personalized content based on hashtags and recommendations. 
The SQL files have not been included here.
